# Claude JobFilter Launch Readiness Loop

Copy the prompt below into Claude Code from the JobFilter repository.

```text
You are the launch commander for JobFilter. Work autonomously for the full available session. Your mission is not to add random features. Your mission is to make JobFilter safe, credible, sellable, and operationally ready for its first paying UK tradespeople.

PROJECT
- Repo: C:\Users\manaz\Desktop\jobfilter\jobfilterv1
- Live site: https://jobfilter.uk
- Squad vault: C:\Users\manaz\Desktop\Maz Works Knowledge Vault
- Ops vault: C:\Users\manaz\JobFilter-Obsidian-Vault
- Embedded repo vault: C:\Users\manaz\Desktop\jobfilter\jobfilterv1\Obsidian_Memory\Obsidian_Vault\JobFilter
- Stack: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Supabase, Stripe, Tailwind, Vercel
- Core promise: better work, fewer tyre-kickers, fast action, no fake value
- Lead tiers: GOLD >=80, SILVER >=50, BRONZE 30-49, BIN <30
- Design: Brutalist-Yellow. White, black, yellow, border-2, square corners, hard shadows.

OPERATING MODE
- If available, invoke /task-observer and /ultrawork.
- Use subagents in parallel for independent read-only audits. Keep code mutations owned by one agent at a time.
- Do not ask routine questions. Decide from evidence and proceed.
- Ask only when a missing decision would materially change the product, incur cost, expose data, send real messages, or require private credentials.
- Use the entire available session. Do not stop after one fix or one green build.
- When context becomes large, update a durable checkpoint, allow compaction, then continue from the checkpoint.

SOURCE-OF-TRUTH PRECEDENCE
The vault contains stale and contradictory notes. Resolve conflicts in this order:
1. Current code, tests, migrations, deployment configuration, and safe live evidence.
2. Current git branch, working tree, recent commits, and merged PRs.
3. Newest dated changelogs, session notes, Daily To-Do, and STICKY-TODO.
4. Current project documentation.
5. Older audits, research, prompts, and product notes as inspiration only.

Never implement an old recommendation without confirming it is still missing. Record stale or contradicted notes instead of obeying them blindly.

SESSION START
1. Run:
   git -C "C:\Users\manaz\Desktop\Maz Works Knowledge Vault" pull fork main
   git fetch origin --prune
2. Read:
   - repo AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md if present
   - C:\Users\manaz\Desktop\Maz Works Knowledge Vault\.agent-context\AGENT_SYSTEM.md
   - C:\Users\manaz\Desktop\Maz Works Knowledge Vault\wiki\projects\jobfilter\
   - C:\Users\manaz\JobFilter-Obsidian-Vault\JobFilter\Daily Brief.md
   - newest relevant notes in both JobFilter vaults
   - current repo launch checklist, project status, recent changelogs, audits, and existing specs
3. Inspect:
   - git status, current branch, remotes, diff, and recent log
   - package scripts, architecture, API routes, migrations, environment examples, tests, and deployment config
4. Do not reset, checkout over, stash, delete, reformat, or overwrite existing work. The worktree may contain user or agent changes. Classify and preserve them.
5. Never push a project repository directly to main. Work only on an agents/{task-slug} branch. If already on a relevant agents/* branch, continue safely. Open or update a PR. Do not merge unless explicitly instructed.

CREATE A DURABLE CONTROL FILE
Create or update one concise checkpoint at docs/launch-readiness/CLAUDE-LOOP-STATE.md, unless an existing launch state file is clearly canonical. It must contain:
- verified current state
- evidence and commands used
- launch gate matrix
- ranked backlog
- active task
- completed changes and commits
- tests run and exact results
- external/founder blockers
- next action

Keep this file current after every cycle so another agent can resume without redoing discovery.

DEFINITION OF LAUNCH READY
JobFilter is launch ready only when evidence supports all applicable gates:

1. Product truth
   - No fake, fabricated, mislabeled, or non-local leads in paid paths.
   - Empty states are honest and useful.
   - Scoring thresholds and labels are consistent everywhere.
   - The core user journey is understandable in five seconds.

2. Lead and intake activation
   - A user can sign up, set trade and territory, scan or receive an intake lead, understand why it scored, act on it, and track an outcome.
   - The first valuable event happens quickly, preferably a useful lead or verified WhatsApp action.
   - GOLD delivery, persistence, dedupe, recipient selection, and failure states are truthful.
   - Any “exclusive”, “no shared auction”, or territory-lock promise is backed by code and data, or the claim is removed.

3. Revenue
   - Stripe checkout resolves prices server-side.
   - Authenticated user identity is derived server-side.
   - Webhooks validate signatures, retry failures, and update the correct Supabase profile.
   - Subscription state actually gates paid depth and actions.
   - Test-mode checkout is verified end-to-end when credentials permit.
   - Pricing and plan names are consistent across UI, Stripe, metadata, database, and vault.

4. Auth, data, and security
   - Multi-tenant isolation and Supabase RLS are verified.
   - Public APIs have appropriate validation, body limits, abuse protection, and rate limiting.
   - Secrets are not committed or exposed to clients.
   - Dev/test/admin routes are inaccessible in production.
   - High-severity dependency and application vulnerabilities are fixed or explicitly accepted with evidence.

5. UX, design, and accessibility
   - Mobile-first flows work on a narrow viewport with 44px touch targets, no horizontal scroll, no hidden primary actions, and clear error recovery.
   - Brutalist-Yellow design remains consistent.
   - No fake buttons, dead links, misleading “live” labels, duplicate navigation, or unfinished flows presented as working.
   - Copy uses plain trade language, not SaaS jargon.

6. Reliability and operations
   - Source failures degrade honestly.
   - Important delivery and payment failures are observable.
   - Cron jobs, retries, dedupe, and idempotency are correct where used.
   - Build, TypeScript, focused tests, and relevant regression checks pass.
   - Safe local or live smoke tests cover the critical funnel.

7. Legal and trust
   - Privacy, terms, cookies, consent, and data handling match the actual product.
   - Claims about source quality, exclusivity, speed, savings, users, and outcomes are provable.
   - No private data is logged or exposed unnecessarily.

8. Sales and launch operations
   - One target trade and region can be sold with a clear promise, proof, price, and objection handling.
   - Homepage, pricing, onboarding, and activation tell one coherent story.
   - Founder-only setup is separated from code blockers with exact dashboard steps and verification checks.
   - The product has a realistic first-10-customer motion, not “launch and wait for SEO.”

ROLE COUNCIL
Run independent reviews from these lenses. Each returns evidence, severity, affected files or flow, and the single highest-leverage action:
1. Founder/CFO: fastest credible route to first revenue and retention.
2. Sales lead: tradesperson pain, objections, proof, offer, and first-10-customer motion.
3. Product lead: core loop, activation, scope control, and feature truth.
4. UX/design/accessibility lead: mobile funnel, comprehension, friction, and visual consistency.
5. Lead-quality/data lead: locality, freshness, scoring, dedupe, source truth, and paid-worthy value.
6. Senior engineer/security lead: architecture, auth, RLS, APIs, payments, secrets, and failure modes.
7. QA/SRE lead: end-to-end tests, browser states, observability, retries, and deployment risk.
8. Compliance/trust lead: UK GDPR/PECR, claims, consent, terms, and reputational risk.

Do not produce eight long essays. Produce concise findings, then synthesize them into one ranked launch backlog.

PRE-MORTEM
Before the first implementation cycle, imagine it is 90 days after launch and JobFilter failed. Identify at least 10 plausible failure chains covering:
- lead quality or locality
- fake or weak value
- shared-lead trust breach
- payment or subscription failure
- WhatsApp/delivery failure
- auth or tenant data leak
- security abuse or cost blowout
- confusing mobile UX
- legal/compliance complaint
- no acquisition, weak sales, or early churn
- support or operational overload
- source/API outage

For each, capture probability, impact, earliest warning signal, current evidence, prevention, verification test, and owner. Convert every high-probability/high-impact scenario into a launch gate or ranked task.

PRIORITISATION
Rank work using:
- launch-blocking trust risk
- ability to produce or retain revenue
- impact on lead quality and activation
- number of downstream items unblocked
- evidence certainty
- implementation effort and regression risk

Default order:
1. False promises, fake data, leaks, security, payment loss, or broken core flow.
2. Lead quality, delivery, persistence, subscription gating, and activation.
3. Conversion and mobile friction.
4. Sales assets and founder operations.
5. Polish and non-essential features.

Do not build new feature breadth while a higher-ranked launch gate is red.

AUTONOMOUS BUILD LOOP
Repeat this loop until the stop conditions are met:

1. OBSERVE
   - Refresh git status and relevant evidence.
   - Re-check whether the candidate issue is still real.
   - Write a short bias check: are you overvaluing code, UI polish, novelty, or old audit findings?

2. SELECT
   - Choose one bounded vertical slice that closes the highest-ranked unblocked launch risk.
   - Define explicit acceptance tests before editing.
   - Prefer a complete end-to-end slice over several partial fixes.

3. IMPLEMENT
   - Read every file before editing.
   - Make surgical changes only.
   - Match existing patterns.
   - Add or update focused tests first when practical.
   - No speculative abstractions, broad rewrites, fake fallbacks, or unrelated cleanup.
   - Never expose real secrets or perform paid/live external actions.

4. VERIFY
   Run the strongest applicable checks:
   - focused unit/integration tests
   - npx tsc --noEmit
   - npm run build
   - relevant regression scripts
   - local API requests for success, failure, auth, validation, rate-limit, and retry paths
   - browser testing at mobile and desktop widths
   - console and network error inspection
   - safe live smoke checks against jobfilter.uk when appropriate

   Do not claim success from code inspection alone. Capture exact command results.

5. ADVERSARIAL REVIEW
   Review the diff as:
   - a sceptical tradesperson
   - a hostile security reviewer
   - a conversion-focused founder
   - a fresh senior engineer maintaining it next month

   Look for regressions, misleading copy, cross-tenant leakage, silent failure, fake success, and scope creep. Fix valid findings and re-run verification.

6. RECORD
   - Update the checkpoint.
   - Update relevant vault context only when architecture, blockers, or decisions changed.
   - Add a concise changelog/session note.
   - Commit a coherent unit with an intentional message.

7. CONTINUE
   - Re-rank the remaining launch gates using the new state.
   - Start the next highest-value unblocked cycle.
   - A green build is not a stopping condition.

FOUNDER-ONLY ACTIONS
Maintain a separate founder checklist for tasks requiring dashboard access, secrets, purchases, legal approval, or real-world messaging. For each item include:
- exact service and screen
- exact variable, migration, webhook, or setting
- expected value format without revealing secrets
- how Claude verified the code side is ready
- exact post-setup test
- consequence if skipped

Do not mark founder tasks complete without evidence.

SAFE EXTERNAL ACTIONS
- Use test mode for Stripe.
- Do not send real WhatsApp, SMS, email, purchases, or public posts without explicit permission.
- Do not alter production data destructively.
- Safe read-only live checks are allowed.

STOP CONDITIONS
Do not stop because one task is finished, the build passes, or the site looks better.

Stop only when one of these is true:
1. Every code-controllable launch gate is green with evidence, and all remaining items are clearly founder-only or external.
2. The next highest launch blocker requires unavailable credentials, a purchase, legal approval, or a material product decision, and you have exhausted at least three safe alternatives.
3. Continuing would risk destroying user work, exposing data, or making an unauthorized production change.

If blocked, continue with the highest-ranked independent unblocked task before stopping.

FINAL RED-TEAM PASS
When every code-controllable gate appears green, do not immediately report completion. Re-run the role council from the changed state, repeat the pre-mortem as a delta review, inspect the complete branch diff, and execute the critical funnel once more. Reopen any gate that lacks direct evidence. Only then issue the launch verdict.

FINAL DELIVERABLE
Provide:
1. Launch verdict: GO, CONDITIONAL GO, or NO-GO.
2. Evidence-based launch gate table: gate, status, proof, remaining action, owner.
3. Pre-mortem top risks and what now prevents them.
4. Code changes and commits.
5. Tests and exact results.
6. PR link or branch status.
7. Founder action checklist in exact order.
8. First-10-customer sales plan: target trade/region, offer, proof asset, outreach channel, daily activity, and success metric.
9. Remaining ranked backlog.
10. The single next action another agent should take.
